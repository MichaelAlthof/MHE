Name of QuantLet : MHEEnsembleEvaluation

Published in : 'MHE - Performance Analysis and Comparison of Metaheuristics for 
                Generating Ensembles of Classifiers'

Description : 	'Accumulates outputs of MHEMetaheuristicEnsembles and performs
	   	test set predictions of ensembles. Predictions are tested for
		differences among scores and among metaheuristics by means of
		the Friedman test. The four best metaheuristics are compared to 
		best base model, simple average ensemble, greedy optimization 
		technique, ensemble selection and LASSO regression.'

Inputs:	'A string path for the initial working directory. This working 
       	directory must contain a folder named datasets in which data 
       	sets in .txt-format are stored, and another folder named predictions 
	that contains outputs produced by MHEModelClassifiers and
	MHEMetaheuristicEnsembles.'

Output:	'TableRankScoreAUC   -	Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding
				AUC
	TableRankScoreTime   -	Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding
				computation time
	TableRankScoreZero   -  Mean ranks of scores in Friedman test regarding

				zero weights
	TablensembleComparison   - Table of best metaheuristics compared to other 
				techniques based on Brier score relative to global
